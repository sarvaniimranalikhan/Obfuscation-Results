# Obfuscation-Results

**PreRequisite:**

*Python(3.4.0)*

*numpy(v_1.16.4)*

*scipy(V_1.3.0)*

*clang(v_6.0.0)*

**Procedure:**

Clone the Repository using git or Download zip.You will have C/C++ normal souce Codes  in *Test SampleCodes*file and their .ll
files in *Test Sample_ll_files* . Obfuscated Codes in *Obfuscated code* and their .ll files in *Obfuscated_ll_files*.
You Can Use Your own Sample codes and Obfuscate them using any products like(Semantic design,Star Force etc..) then generate
ll files using Clang or CLang++.

Now Create your own Binaries(.so files)  with specific Dimensions(like 200D,300D etc..).Now with These binaries generate *Vectors*.
for the Normal codes and Obfuscated Codes using their '.ll' files.

In the Main code change the file paths to your Own vector files and Run the Code.

Output file will be generated.
